//	                ex:
//	                         rate = 50;
//	                        taxRate = 0.3;         
//		                   weeklyHours = 40;
//
//	                    then output will be:
//	                            your salary is: 96000 USD
//	                            your total tax is: 28800 USD
//	                            your income after tax is: ---- USD
//
//	                Assume that a year has 48 weeks (excluding PTO)
